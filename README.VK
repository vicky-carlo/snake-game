Snake Game
This is a classic Snake Game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The game provides a simple and interactive interface where the player controls a snake and tries to eat food while avoiding collisions with the boundaries of the game window and the snake's own tail.

How to Play
Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) on your keyboard to control the movement of the snake.
The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the boundaries or the snake's tail.
Each time the snake eats food, its length will increase, and your score will go up.
If the snake collides with the boundaries or its own tail, the game will end, and your final score will be displayed.
Press the spacebar to restart the game after it ends.
